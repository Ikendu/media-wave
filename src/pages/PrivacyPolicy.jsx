            A Customer can choose to permit or restrict Third-Party Services for
            its Workspace. Typically, Third-Party Services are software that
            integrate with our Services, and a Customer can permit its
            Authorized Users to enable and disable these integrations for its
            Workspace. Andromedia may also develop and offer Andromedia
            applications that connect the Services with a Third-Party Service.
            Once enabled, the provider of a Third-Party Service may share
            certain information with Andromedia. For example, if a cloud storage
            application is enabled to permit files to be imported to a
            Workspace, we may receive the user name and email address of
            Authorized Users, along with additional information that the
            application has elected to make available to Andromedia to
            facilitate the integration. Authorized Users should check the
            privacy settings and notices in these Third-Party Services to
            understand what data may be disclosed to Andromedia. When a
            Third-Party Service is enabled, Andromedia is authorized to connect
            and access Other Information made available to Slack in accordance
            with our agreement with the Third-Party Provider and any
            permission(s) granted by Customer (including, by its Authorized
            User(s)). We do not, however, receive or store passwords for any of
            these Third-Party Services when connecting them to the Services.
